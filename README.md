## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run Sailsmakr locally, ensure you have the following tools installed:

- **Docker**: For running the application in a containerized environment.
- **Python 3.x**: For the backend.
- **Node.js & npm**: For managing frontend dependencies and build tools.
- **Jenkins**: If you plan to set up continuous integration and testing locally.

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/sailsmakr/sailsmakr.git
    cd sailsmakr
    ```

2. **Set Up the Backend**:
    - Create a Python virtual environment and install dependencies:
      ```bash
      python3 -m venv venv
      source venv/bin/activate
      pip install -r requirements.txt
      ```

3. **Set Up the Frontend**:
    - Install npm dependencies:
      ```bash
      npm install
      ```

4. **Set Up Environment Variables**:
    - Create a `.env` file and add the necessary environment variables, such as API keys for OpenCage, FedEx, Freightos, and database credentials.

## Code Infrastructure

Sailsmakr's backend is powered by **Flask**, which handles API requests and core business logic. Infrastructure is managed programmatically with Terraform, ensuring consistency and scalability.
